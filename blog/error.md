I am particularly interested in your interpretation and reaction to figure 6.1 in Longley et al (2008) with regards to the three questions/prompts below:

Do you have first-hand knowledge or experience with uncertainty in spatial/geographic research?

What responsibilties do geographers have with regards to uncertainty in research?

What strategies might geographers use to fulfill those responsibilities?

Representing our world through maps has always brought problems. As Longley et al. (2008) state, "it is impossible to make a perfect representation of the world, so uncertainty about it is inevitable". A simple example is the world map; there is no possible way of representing our spheric world in a flat surface without compromising the size, the shape of the land or the distance between two points. Nevertheless, these uncertain or innacurate representions of our world may still be useful to us.

As Longely et al. (2008) depicts in figure 6.1, as we move from the "real world" through each of the "filters" of research, the representation of the world becomes more distorted. In my experience in my Remote Sensing and Land Use class, we dealt with issues in the "conception" when trying to define what a forest meant for different communities in different locations. In Burkina Faso, dry areas with dispersed trees are considered forrests, while in Rwanda forests are only those with the highest densities of canopy cover. However, deciding the threshold percent of canopy cover that we would use to classify a pixel as forest became a very subjective task. Thus, the forest areas calculated from that classification may have been over or underestimated depending on what we conceptualized as a forest in our code.
