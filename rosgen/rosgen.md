title: Replication of Kasprak et al. (2016) Rosgen Classification of the John Day River Basin, OR.
---

### Brief Description:

Kasprak et al (2016) conducted a comparative study of different frameworks of stream/river classification in the Middle Fork John Day Basin within the Columbia River Basin in Oregon, USA. Kasprak et al. (2016) classified 33 sites using the River Styles Framework, Natural Channel Classification, Rosgen Classification System, and a channel form-based statistical classification, and compared these results to analyze the consistency or discrepancy of the classifications. 

As a class, we replicated the Rosgen classification portion of the Kasprak et al (2016) study. Each student was assigned one of the 33 sites to carry out the replication of the Rosgen classification with the purpose of assessing the replicability of the Kasprak methodology for the Rosgen classification and reflecting on issues of replicability.
