### Introduction
Developing a classification schema for rivers and streams is a hard task. The everchanging nature of these systems as well as the practicality to take measurements on the field are limitations to river classification. The various classifications methods available may also produce different results on the same river. Therefore, Kasprak et al. (2016) were motivated to conduct a direct comparison between 4 different classification frameworks to analyze their agreements and discrepancies.

Kasprak et al (2016) conducted their study in the Middle Fork John Day Basin within the Columbia River Basin in Oregon, USA. They classified rivers/ streams on 33 sites using the River Styles Framework, Natural Channel Classification, Rosgen Classification System, and a channel form-based statistical classification.

As a class, we replicated the Rosgen classification portion of the Kasprak et al (2016) study. Each student was assigned one of the 33 sites to carry out the replication of the Rosgen classification. I was assigned Loc_ID 8, Granite Boulder Creek.




### Original Study Information
1. The Kasprak et al. paper can be found [here]( https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0150293)

Kasprak et al. followed the Rosgen Classification System (RCS) on Level I and II (Fig. 1) to generate the classifications. They used DEMs (0.1m grid resolution), aerial imagery (1m res), and ground-based assessments to calculate the ratios needed in Level I. In their case, they used the used the River Bathymetry (RBT) to calculate width to depth and entrenchment and sinuosity. They relied on the CHaMP surveys to inform median grain size (D50) at each point and classify each reach to Level II in the RCS.
