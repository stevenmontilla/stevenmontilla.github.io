## Introduction
Kang et al. (2020) developed a replicable methodology to assess accessibility to hospital beds and ventilators in the city of Chicago. Their motivation was the rapid growth of the COVID-19 pandemic. They emphasize the need for rapidly diagnosing access to healthcare, and developed a methodology that generates this information rather quickly. Moreover, they publicly published their methodology through a Pyhton Notebook that outlines and provides almost everything needed for analysis.
