## Abstract

The original study is a multi-criteria analysis of vulnerability to Climate Change in Malawi, and is one of the earliest sub-national geographic models of climate change vulnerability for an African country. The study aims to be replicable, and had 40 citations in Google Scholar as of April 8, 2021.

## Original Study Information

The study region is the country of Malawi. The spatial support of input data includes DHS survey points, Traditional Authority boundaries, and raster grids of flood risk (0.833 degree resolution) and drought exposure (0.416 degree resolution).

The original study was published without data or code, but has detailed narrative description of the methodology. The methods used are feasible for undergraduate students to implement following completion of one introductory GIS course. The study states that its data is available for replication in 23 African countries.


### Data Description and Variables

Outline the data used in the study, including:

- sources of each data layer and
- the variable(s) used from each data source
- transformations applied to the variables (e.g. rescaling variables, calculating derived variables, aggregating to different geographic units, etc.)

This part may be compiled collaboratively as a group!
#### Overview
Malcomb et al. (2014) calculated household resilience seen in scores using three different data sources (refer to Fig. 2 of Malcomb et al. 2014)
- The variables to calculate Adaptive Capacity were obtained from the USAID's Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS).
- Livelihood sensitivity variables were taken from the USAID's Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWSNET).
- Finally, physical exposure variables were taken from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).


#### Background of Data Sources

##### USAID's Demographic and Health Surveys
  [Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS)](https://dhsprogram.com/Methodology/Survey-Types/DHS.cfm) are nationally-representative household surveys that provide data for a wide range of monitoring and impact evaluation indicators in the areas of population, health, and nutrition (from DHS website). These surveys record assets and access to resources at the household level. The following list outlines the specific variables that were taken into account in this part of the replication. Specifically, DHS data was only used to obtain assets and access data to calculate Adaptive Capacity (40% of the Household Resilience Score). DHS data requires use authorization by the DHS and therefore cannot be shared in this report or through the data repository. You can get authorization to obtain the data on this [here](https://dhsprogram.com/)

##### USAID's Famine Early Warning Network (FEWSNET)
[FEWSNET](https://fews.net/about-us), the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, is a leading provider of early warning and analysis on acute food insecurity around the world (from FEWSNET website). One of the goals of the FEWSNET is to predict future cases of acute food insecurity in order to inform humanitarian response. Therefore, the data they collect is tailored towards measuring the vulnerability of communities mainly focused on land use practices, food sourcing, and coping strategies of the communities surveyed. Malcomb et al. (2014) used variables from the FEWSNET 2005 survey in Malawi to calculate the 20% Livelihood Sensitivity portion of the Household Resilience scores. However, they were not clear on which variables exactly they used, so we had to use our judgement to make the our best informed guesses. The following table shows the attributes and calculations that we carried out in contrast to what was listed in the paper.

##### United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)/ Global Resource Information Database (GRID) Data:

The GRID-Geneva database comes from a partnership between the UNEP, the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment and the University of Geneva. Their focus is on processing, analysis and creating models from satellite data using remote sensing techniques and GIS with the goal of providing scientific information to decision makers.(Learn more [here](https://unepgrid.ch/en/about-us/grid]))
The Global Risk Data Platforms is the product of a multiagency effort to share spatial information on global risk from natural hazards. (Learn more [here](https://preview.grid.unep.ch/))

- Following the procedure from Malcomb et al. (2014), we obtained the Estimated Risk for Flood Hazard and Exposition to Drought Events layers from this data source.

#### Data transformations

The first transformation of the data was normalization. Since all variables used came in different units, it would be impossible to compare them without normalizing them. Malcomb et al. (2014) do so by transforming all variables to a scale of 0-5 (6 data categories). However, the script becomes confusing when they mention that they used quintiles (5 data categories). Since their highest score was 5, but they only had 5 categories, we used the quintile breaks and modified it to be a scale from 1-5 resulting in 5 total categories.

Capacity scores were weighted following table 2. of Malcomb et al. and then summed to calculate capacity scores with the corresponding weighted variables. We multiplied the score by 20 to match the scale on Malcomb et al's figures.



### Analytical Specification

The original study was conducted using ArcGIS and STATA, but does not state which versions of these software were used.
The replication study will use R.

## Materials and Procedure

### Step 1: Preprocessing of Geographic Boundaries

#### Workflow First Version

DHS Households table (1 row/house) â†’ ***field calc*** â†’ conversion to 0-5 scale â†’ weighted A/C score â†’ ***join by attribute*** w/ DHS data points (village level) â†’ ***spatial join AND group*** w/ traditional authorities (GADM adm_2) â†’ traditional authorities w/ Capacity Score â†’ ***Raster***

1. Use zonal statistics to aggregate raster to TA geometry for final calculation of vulnerability in each traditional authority

#### Final Revision

Besides what is above, we added the variables for the Livelihood zones procedures and the comparison methodology.

## Unplanned Deviations from the Protocol

Summarize changes and uncertainties between

## Discussion

Provide a summary and interpretation of the key findings of the replication *vis-a-vis* the original study results. If the attempt was a failure, discuss possible causes of the failure. In this replication, any failure is probably due to practical causes, which may include:
- lack of data
- lack of code
- lack of details in the original analysis
- uncertainties due to manner in which data has been used

Epistemic uncertainty from use of expert opinion: Malcomb attribute designations

## Conclusion

Restate the key findings and discuss their broader societal implications or contributions to theory.
Do the research findings suggest a need for any future research?
